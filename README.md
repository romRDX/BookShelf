## Before Starting

Please do notice that there are two projects folders within this repository, one uses Redux (App-Redux) and the other uses ContextAPI (App-ContextAPI) to share all the needed information with every component. The getting started proccess is the same for both, they are the exact same project with different ways of managing the state of the application.

## Getting Started

After downloading the project from this repository, enter any of the two folders inside:

```
cd App-Redux

```

or

```
cd App-ContextAPI

```

When inside one of those folders you will need to run:

```
yarn

```

This will install all dependencies of the project, after that run:

```
yarn start

```

Wait a few seconds and the application will open on your browser.
